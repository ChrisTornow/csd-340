        <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>
        <p>Just two hours ago a company has attempted the first ever launch of the Starship.  This is the largest
            and most powerful spacecraft in history, producing over 10x thrust of the previous.  History is being
            made by <span id = "var1">_____</span> and going to see one of these launches should be on your bucket list.
            <br><br>
            One day we will be on Mars, but I do not believe we will be fully inhabiting within our lifetime.  We
            have much needed progress to be made on earth yet with <span id = "var2">_____</span> transportation.  Our aviation
            vehicles are many decades old and even though the <span id = "var3">_____</span> has scaled, we still have a long
            way to go.
            <br><br>
            Many of the launches are available to watch from either Florida or Texas bases.  You can check out the 
            schedules online to see when the next <span id = "var4">_____</span> will happen nearest to you.  These are something
            else to witness.  The feeling of the shockwave even miles away is unreal and such an amazing experience.
