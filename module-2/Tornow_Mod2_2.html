        <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1 - Bellevue University</h2>
        <p class="intro">It all started 3 semesters ago at Bellevue University.  
            My journey began as signing up for Management of Information Systems, 
            but I have always had a passion for programming.  So when I started my 
            academics I broadened my ellectives to mostly software development.
        </p>
        <p>The first class that I took at Bellevue University was Python.  This 
            was programming language that I had never used in the past, but grew 
            to love it my semester end.  It is such an easy language to grasp and 
            quickly build within.  I do wish there was additional tools that assist 
            within form design; maybe they exist, but we did not dig into within 
            this course.  <span class="sentence">This was my first taste of programming within the 
            academic realm and I was loving it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Following the rush of finalizing my python course I started into Java 
            programming.  This was more complex syntax for sure, but the 
            capabilities it offered were much beyond Python.  Again, learning 
            the basics of Java made me thirst for more knowledge of programming.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, just last semester I finished Java intermediate course.  This 
            was a notch higher for difficulty, but even more rewarding.  I love 
            programming and will continue this quest with as many of these 
            classes that are available.
        </p>
